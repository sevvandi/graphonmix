Description: Generates (U,W) mixture graphs where U is a line graph graphon and W is a dense graphon. Graphons are graph limits and graphon U can be written as sequence of positive numbers adding to 1. Graphs are sampled from U and W and joined randomly to obtain the mixture graph. Given a mixture graph, U can be inferred. Kandanaarachchi and Ong (2025) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2505.13864>.
