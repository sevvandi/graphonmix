Description: Generates (U,W) mixture graphs where U is a line graph graphon 
    and W is a dense graphon. Graphons are graph limits and graphon U can be
    written as sequence of positive numbers adding to 1. Graphs are sampled 
    from U and W and joined randomly to obtain the mixture graph. Given a mixture 
    graph, U can be inferred.
